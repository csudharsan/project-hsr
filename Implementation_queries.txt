1. Lets say the same issue is reported by 2 or more public, 
    how we are going to handle it?
    How do the agents know that both people are reporting the same issue?
Probable soln: If the issue is received to agents from same location, then either agents should ask for a photo of the issue
                location or the public should be notified to asking for the photo automatically by the business logic to be 
                implemented in the system for more details.
2. How do you know the no: of agents needed to handle an issue?
   for example: one agent cant handle a loss of life issue
Probable soln: No of agents needed should be catogorized based on the issue type.

The biggest challenge is the app should be simple for the public and should also give the agents more insights regarding the problem.
